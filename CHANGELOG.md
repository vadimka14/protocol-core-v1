## v1.0.0-beta-rc3

This release finalizes the external-facing implementation of core modules and registries, as well as the public interfaces and events:

- Split old LicensingRegistry into LicenseRegistry and LicensingModule, where the former stores and deals with all 1155-related data & actions, and the latter stores and facilitates all policy-related data & actions (#72)
- Introduce the IPAssetRegistry that replaces IPRecordRegistry and inherits IPAccountRegistry (#46)
- Add logic and helper contracts to the royalty system using 0xSplits to facilitate enforceable on-chain royalty payment (#53)
- Integrate the core royalty and licensing logic to enforce the terms of commercial license policies with royalty requirements on derivatives (#60, #65, #67)
- Accommodate a modifier-based approach for Access Control; Provide optionality for access control checks; and Improve other AccessController states and functionalities (#45, #63, #70)
- Enable mutable royalty policy settings to provide greater flexibility for IPAccount owners (#67, #73)
- Finalize the canonical metadata provider with flexible provisioning (#49)

- Enable multi-parent linking for derivatives (#56) and add policy compatibility checks for multi-parent and multi-derivative linking (#61, #66)
- Enhance the UMLPolicyFrameworkManager and UMLPolicy with new structs and fields to execute compatibility checks easily and more efficiently (#65)
- Establish a new integration test framework and test flows and improve existing unit test frameworks (#52, #57, #58)
- Create a basic, functioning Disputer Module with arbitration settings (#62)
- Review interfaces, events, and variables (#76) and GitHub PR actions (#36, #58)
- Refactor contracts for relative imports (#75)
